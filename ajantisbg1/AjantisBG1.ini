# Full name of the mod, without version number
Name = Ajantis BG1 Expansion Modification

# Author name or nick, don't use email address
Author = jastey

# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = For original BG1 (with or without TotSC), the mod adds a friendship track and the BG1NPC project romance for Ajantis. The original BG1NPC project romance was slightly altered to adjust to the restrictions of the BG1 engine, although overall the content stayed the same.

For Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET, the mod adds a friendship track and more romance content for the BG1NPC Project romance for Ajantis. Content-wise, the mod is meant as an addition to the BG1NPC project, but technically it can be installed and played without the BG1NPC project.

For BG:EE and EET there will be a second install option to use the existent BAM for Ajantis' shield (green dragon on golden back), if BG1NPC is installed.
