His skill and devotion apparently brought him to the attention of the paladin Keldorn, one of the most respected of the order, who decided to take Ajantis under his wing as a squire. Recently Ajantis has asked for the honor of becoming a full-fledged member of the order. To accomplish this he has traveled to the Sword Coast, in order to help curtail the increased humanoid activity in the region.

@297  = ~It surely does, and I hope it will be your name one day.~
@298  = ~Do you think so, my love? You did not seem to be very fond of my noble family background.~

@325  = ~Let us proceed in investigating the machinations of the Iron Throne. The evil conspiracy has to be destroyed!~
@326  = ~The path takes you back to your origin. Evil seems to be hiding in the great halls of Candlekeep library, so we shall go there and defeat it!~
@327  = ~This is outrageous. We are treated like murderers! We have to prove the righteousness of our actions!~
@328  = ~This conspiracy is getting thicker and thicker. We have to find who is behind all this!~

@332  = ~Never hesitate to fulfill your duty. Always be vigilant, and be prepared for unexpected attacks.~
@333  = ~Always train to improve your prowess. Your enemies will overpower you easily, if you are not prepared.~
@334  = ~It is night, so let us find a resting place soon. It is not good to overextend ourselves.~

@336  = ~Get rid of the evil in this group! It is contaminating our presence.~
@337  = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot agree to the way we treat the people seeking our help. I see you making bad decisions and turning down pleas for help. This is not the way we should behave on our glorious search!~
@338  = ~I hear your words... You sound very determined. I will accept your decision, although it makes my heart bleed.~
@339  = ~By Helm! So let us end our deep personal bond and return to being nothing but fighting comrades. *sighs* I will stay at your side and support you in our current fight.~

@3822 = ~No time for idle conversation. I feel evil next to us!~ [X#BLANK]
