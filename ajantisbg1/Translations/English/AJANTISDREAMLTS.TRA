@0    = ~My lady, I noticed you tossing in your sleep... By Helm, you are drowned in sweat! What is the matter?~
@1    = ~I had a weird dream about Mulahey...~
@2    = ~It was horrible, Ajantis... Something frightened  me out of sleep!~
@3    = ~Nothing, really... Just a bad dream, but that's not uncommon in the situation we are in.~
@4    = ~It's all right, Ajantis. No need to worry.~
@5    = ~My love, I noticed you tossing in your sleep... By Helm, you are drowned in sweat! What is the matter?~
@6    = ~What a nightmare! Please hold me for a moment, will you?~
@7    = ~It is no wonder these happenings are giving you bad dreams, my lady. You haven't been trained to fight and kill evil enemies threatening your life. Mulahey seemed to be our main enemy, until we discovered that there is obviously an even bigger organisation behind it...~
@8    = ~No, it wasn't Mulahey that turned my dream into a nightmare... It seemed more like a foreboding of some... very determined hostile power that's awaiting me.~
@9    = ~Maybe you are right. What we are going through is a bit hard to swallow. I will see that I get a decent rest soon.~
@10   = ~Well, it's all right, Ajantis. No need to worry.~
@11   = ~It is no wonder these happenings are giving you bad dreams, my love. You haven't been trained to fight and kill evil enemies threatening your life. Mulahey seemed to be our main enemy, until we discovered that there is obviously an even bigger organisation behind it...~
@12   = ~No, it wasn't Mulahey that turned my dream into a nightmare... It seemed more like a foreboding of some... very determined hostile power that's awaiting me.~
@13   = ~That is true, my lady. It is no wonder these happenings are giving you bad dreams. You haven't been trained to fight and kill evil enemies threatening your life. Even defeating Mulahey didn't bring us the victory we might have expected. It only gave us the knowledge that there might be a bigger organisation behind it...~
@14   = ~That is true, <CHARNAME>. It is no wonder these happenings are giving you bad dreams. You haven't been trained to fight and kill evil enemies threatening your life. Even defeating Mulahey did not bring us the victory we might have expected. It only gave us the knowledge that there might be a bigger organisation behind it...~
@15   = ~Our travels and fights are very demanding. I suggest you make sure you get enough rest to gather your strength. We cannot allow ourselves to be weakened when our glorious task requires fighting the next enemy!~
@16   = ~It is easy to feel like we’re being chased if we have to be aware of attacking enemies every moment! Our travels and fights are very demanding. I suggest you make sure you get enough rest to gather your strength. We cannot allow ourselves to be weakened when our glorious task requires that we be prepared to fight the next enemy at any moment!~
@17   = ~Of course, my love. *Ajantis puts his arms around you* Do you want to talk about it?~
@18   = ~No, that's not necessary. It was just a bad dream, not uncommon in the situation we are in.~
@19   = ~Our travels and fights are very demanding. I suggest you make sure you get enough rest to gather your strength. We can't allow ourselves to be weakened when our glorious task requires fighting the next enemy!~
@20   = ~I hope you get better rest next time.~
@21   = ~Saying that, I would suggest that I... take over your next turn of night watch, my lady. To give you more time to relax. It is important that our leader is well rested, and... I feel bad seeing you so upset.~
@22   = ~Saying that, I would suggest that I take over your next turn of night watch, my love. To give you more time to relax. *Ajantis caresses your cheek with his hand.* Tell me if I can do anything else for you. I feel bad seeing you so upset.~
@23   = ~My lady, I didn't get the impression you had a very restful night.~
@24   = ~Indeed... I dreamed about a stone statue of *me* somewhere deep down in the earth... And the threat that I could be destroyed like the statue could be shattered.~
@25   = ~I had a nightmare after which I couldn't sleep again...~
@26   = ~I didn't, but it's over now. No need to worry, let's start the day.~
@27   = ~My love, I didn't get the impression you had a very restful night.~
@28   = ~I see...~
@29   = ~And a voice was talking about my powers only being borrowed... And that I have to pay for it, eventually.~
@30   = ~Well, whatever. It's over now, so let's start the day.~
@31   = ~I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?~
@32   = ~I dreamed about a stone statue of *me* somewhere deep down in the earth... And the threat that I could be destroyed like the statue could be shattered.~
@33   = ~No, thank you. It's over now. No need to worry, let's start the day.~
@34   = ~Your powers only borrowed? That is a strange thought. Yet there *is* something special about your dreams, as you gain powers through them...*pauses in thoughtful silence*~
@35   = ~Whatever the reason might be, don't let yourself be frightened by images which seem to be forebodings of a threat in the future! We are on the righteous quest of saving the Sword Coast from the criminals that are menacing the lands! Whether or not an evil might is threatening you, you will only find out if you succeed in your search. Whatever enemy is awaiting us - we will not give it the chance to catch us unaware!~
@36   = ~There *is* something special about your dreams, as you gain powers through them...*pauses in thoughtful silence*~
@37   = ~Whatever the reason for your nightmares might be, don't let yourself be frightened by images which seem to be forebodings of a threat in the future! We are on the righteous quest of saving the Sword Coast from the criminals that are menacing the lands! We will not give them the chance to catch us in a moment of inattention!~
@38   = ~Don't let yourself be frightened, because you have loyal companions that are fighting by your side. I told you before, I will help you against our enemies with all my might. I will be there to protect... to help you, <CHARNAME>.~
@39   = ~Don't let yourself be frightened, because you have loyal companions that are fighting by your side. I will help you against our enemies with all my might. I will be there to help you, and to protect you, my love <CHARNAME>.~
@40   = ~My lady, I heard you shouting... Are you all right?~
@41   = ~I... I didn't kill him!~
@42   = ~I dreamed of Gorion. I dreamed I was responsible for his death... It was another dream of hints and clues about some evil heritage I am carrying.~
@43   = ~That was an awful nightmare. I was in Candlekeep again...~
@44   = ~I'm fine. I'm fine, Ajantis. Let's get up.~
@45   = ~My love, I heard you shouting... Are you all right?~
@46   = ~*Put your arms around him* Hold me, Ajantis!~
@47   = ~Who are you talking about? Calm down, <CHARNAME>! You just awoke from a nightmare. It is all right now.~
@48   = ~I meant Gorion. I dreamed I was responsible for his death... It was another dream of hints and clues about some evil heritage I am carrying.~
@49   = ~Oh, Ajantis! What an awful nightmare. I was in Candlekeep again...~
@50   = ~Nothing, it was only a dream. Let's get up.~
@51   = ~Seeing images of childhood does not necessarily turn a dream into a nightmare... What happened?~
@52   = ~Well, this time it was. Let's get up, I'm all right.~
@53   = ~Some evil heritage... *looks at you thoughtfully*~
@54   = ~So shall it be. With Helm's help we will face and shatter whatever evil is awaiting us!~
@55   = ~You did not look "fine" a moment ago, <CHARNAME>!~
@56   = ~I dreamed of Gorion. I dreamt that I was responsible for his death... It was another dream of hints and clues about some evil heritage I am carrying.~
@57   = ~I don't want to talk about it, Ajantis.~
@58   = ~It's none of your business, Ajantis, and I don't want to talk about it.~
@59   = ~There are signs indeed, yet I cannot sense the evil in you. It all seems to be connected: Gorion's death, the enemies threatening you, your dreams... We should continue on the path we are following now with steadiness and courage. It will lead us to the cause of your troubles!~
@60   = ~Yes, and I know now that I have to return to Candlekeep. In the halls of my childhood, destiny awaits us.~
@61   = ~*sigh* I guess there is no other way than to "continue on this path". I'm not able to flee from my heritage, whatever it might be.~
@62   = ~Yes, sure. It was only a dream. Let's get up.~
@63   = ~Yes, sure. It was only a dream.~
@64   = ~I have to accept this, I guess, although you have very powerful nightmares, my love. It all seems to be connected: Gorion's death, the enemies threatening you, your dreams... *looks at you thoughtfully* We should continue on the path we are following now with steadiness and courage. It will lead us to the cause of your troubles!~
@65   = ~Then forgive me my obtrusiveness, my lady. You have very powerful nightmares, and it all seems to be connected: Gorion's death, the enemies threatening you, the dreams... *looks at you thoughtfully*~
@66   = ~We should continue on the path we are following now with steadiness and courage. It will lead us to the cause of your troubles!~
@67   = ~Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?~
@68   = ~*Ajantis takes you in his arms* Are you all right, my love?~
@69   = ~*Ajantis massages your shoulders and back with firm movements of his fingers.* I hope this will make you feel better in a moment, my love. Try to relax...~
@70   = ~Might I... suggest a massage, my love, to ease your tension?~
@71   = ~That would be great.~
@72   = ~Ah, don't worry. Let's get up.~
