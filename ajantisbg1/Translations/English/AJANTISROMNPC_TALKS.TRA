@0    = ~Tell me, Jaheira and Khalid, you are travelling together and it is obvious that you are... enjoying your closeness. But your path is leading you to very dangerous places... Did it ever enter your mind that you would actually prefer your weaker part to be somewhere safe at home while the other one is out doing the traveling and fighting?~
@1    = ~And which of us would be the weak one, please?... Ajantis, you can't watch over the balance of good and evil by sitting at home, so that was never an option for us. Khalid and I are fighting together, and there is no other way we want live our lives, as long as there is need for our swords. This way of life has become part of our relationship over time.~
@2    = ~Khalid wasn't the adventuring type when I met him, but he has gotten accustomed to it quite well. Either one of us would be unhappy if we had to spend the rest of our lives bound to a place you call "home". There is a type of person that is not meant to live bound to one place.~
@3    = ~...Who is not meant... I... see. Jaheira, I thank you for your answer to my question.~
@4    = ~If the r-reason you are asking was because we were being a bit obvious, maybe we could be a bit more d-discreet the next time.~
@5    = ~I beg your pardon, Khalid?~
@6    = ~No, no, none of your behaviour led me to these words, my friends... I'm sorry if I made that impression. It was... just a thought.~
@7    = ~Dynaheir, Rashemi culture says a witch and a warrior should go on dajemma together...~
@8    = ~It doth not always happen that a Hathran is accompanied by a berserker on her dajemma. Many of my sisters travel in groups or alone, and so do men.~
@9    = ~*Coughs* But if they do travel together... what would you think if the two not only improved their abilities and knowledge of different cultures, but if they grew closer, as close as, err... it can be?~
@10   = ~‘Tis strongly discouraged. Hathran is a mother to her people, sister and daughter. She must love all Rashemi equally... and a dajemma is for seeking knowledge of a different kind.~
@11   = ~I see, Dynaheir. Thank you for giving me your opinion.~
@12   = ~*Looking at <CHARNAME> thoughtfully* Yet love is a noble emotion. ‘Tis said that it hath enough power to purify souls, like a forge’s fire purifies ore and giveth us shiny metal.~
@13   = ~It sometimes happens that adventuring companions fall in love. Othlot of Rashemen will not frown on two virtuous hearts that beat as one, if the lovers derive strength and valor from their feeling. ‘Tis indeed great luck to ever have a beloved near, even in the foreign land.~
@14   = ~*murmurs* ...great luck to have one's beloved near...~
@15   = ~Thou wert saying?~
@16   = ~Oh, nothing, nothing. I... was asking out of principle, of course.~
@17   = ~*Dynaheir smiles slowly, knowingly* Indeed... and if by a chance of the draw <CHARNAME> would be interested in a similar bit of Rashemi lore, I should tell her no different.~
@18   = ~Yeslick, may I ask you a question?~
@19   = ~Aye, lad. What d’ye want to know?~
@20   = ~I was wondering... In your culture, is it usual for a man and a woman... dwarf... to be together living a life like we do now?~
@21   = ~Eh... me clan mostly lived in the great mine, lad. We didn't travel much, what wi’ th’ Cloakwood all round. No need, anyhow.~
@22   = ~I didn't mean necessarily *travelling*. I meant... couples that where formed while doing the same, dangerous deeds, let's say mining...~
@23   = ~Oh... aye, sure there were. Ain’t strange at all, there ain’t no better way to get t’know a maiden than to work alongside her on a project. Happened a lot.~
@24   = ~Did it?~
@25   = ~Aye, and I ain’t gonna say it were a bad thing, neither. When ye’re down in th’ darkness, ye trust the one next to ye wi’ yer life. Th’ minin’ props they build, th’ strokes they make, either followin’ yer lead or lettin’ em lead ye. When ye work in th’ mines, ye form bonds, lad, be they jus’ friendships or more, bonds fer life... *sighs* Well, let’s not dwell on thoughts like tha’. I know why ye’re askin’...~
@26   = ~*With a quick look* You do?~
@27   = ~Aye, to learn about me people, eh? *winks*~
@28   = ~Ah, well,...~
@29   = ~Let me tell ye this, me friend: if ye mine a diamond, count yer blessings, fer if ye cut an' polish her right, she'll be a thing to gladden yer heart, aye. But jus' let her collect dust, she'll stop gleaming fer ye soon enough!~
@30   = ~I will think about this advice, though I am... not sure why you are telling me this.~
@31   = ~Ye will understand, lad. I’m sure ye will.~
@32   = ~Branwen, if you could spare a minute...~
@33   = ~What is it, Ajantis?~
@34   = ~In your culture, how is it treated if fighting comrades develop feelings of... intimate closeness... and affection more than would be appropriate?~
@35   = ~'More than appropriate' is a question of definition, Ajantis. If a man and a woman fall in love with the blessings of Tempus, how could you call it inappropriate?~
@36   = ~Well, there *is* such a thing... Tell me, Branwen, you are a very brave woman, a warrior priestess... wouldn't you wish your husband to stay at a place where you know him safe?~
@37   = ~Yes and no, Ajantis - Where could I protect my beloved better than having him right by my side?~
@38   = ~...Protect... There seems to be some truth in those words, indeed, Branwen. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.~
