@0    = ~My lady, as a squire paladin of the Order of the Radiant Heart, I am accustomed to traveling with heavy armour and equipment, more than you might be, I presume, as such a beautiful lady... *ahem* I have still some space left in my pack. May I offer to carry some of your equipment for you? At least until you are more accustomed to this lifestyle?~
@1    = ~That's very kind of you, Ajantis. I'd be happy If you would carry some of my things~
@2    = ~That's a nice offer, although not necessary. Strictly speaking, I'm even stronger than you are...~
@3    = ~No, thank you, Ajantis.~
@4    = ~Don't be silly. I'm not *that* weak!~
@5    = ~Ajantis, stop talking nonsense. I am quite comfortable with the way things are, and I don't think you can judge that.~
@6    = ~It would be my pleasure, my lady.~
@7    = ~You are strong, but it is of little use if you have not yet adapted to this lifestyle. But I did not mean to be intrusive, my lady.~
@8    = ~As you please. I did not mean to be intrusive, my lady.~
@9    = ~I did not mean to imply that you are too weak, my lady. It very much depends on whether you are used to this lifestyle. But I did not mean to be intrusive, my lady.~
@10   = ~Then let me apologize, although I think I am quite capable of judging my opponents, be it friend or foe! But I did not mean to be intrusive, my lady.~
@11   = ~At times like these, when the sun is standing low, spreading its red light across the land, the beauty and uniqueness of this world comes to mind even stronger than usual. I have found it to be a motivation not to hesitate in the crucial fight against evil! In moments like these I gain strength for this fight.~
@12   = ~The sun is illuminating you, too, with its special light, my lady... *stops and clears his throat*~
@13   = ~Ajantis, do I hear a compliment in this?~
@14   = ~Same for you. Your armour now looks... *pink*... *giggles*~
@15   = ~Did your ears just turn red, or did I imagine it?~
@16   = ~We are outside, Ajantis. It would be surprising if the sun wasn't shining on me as well as everyone in the group.~
@17   = ~You are a very impressive woman, my lady. *reddens* I mean, as the leader that you are. We... should move on and not neglect our duties!~
@18   = ~I beg your pardon? We are walking with heavy armour, my lady, I guess it is no wonder that the strain should show somewhere!~
@19   = ~*looks down on himself* Indeed... My lady, it always makes me wonder how one thing can create such beauty and distortion at the same time!~
@20   = ~Oh, don't worry, Ajantis! You look like a shining knight this way! It's rather impressive!~
@21   = ~Well, sometimes that's how it goes.~
@22   = ~You are a very impressive woman, yourself, my lady. *reddens* I mean, as the leader that you are. We... should move on and not neglect our duties!~
@23   = ~Be assured that the light does not disfigure you at all, my lady, on the contrary... *reddens* We should move on and not neglect our duties!~
@24   = ~There is no need for sarcasm, my lady. I only wanted to share this beautiful sight with you. *ahem* We should move on and not neglect our duties!~
@25   = ~My lady, as a squire I was responsible for my mentor's equipment, and gathered a lot of useful skills. I can prepare a comfortable sleeping place without effort, out of only a few blankets, for example. You, as our leader, have so many things you are responsible for already. Do you want me to take care of your bedroll tonight?~
@26   = ~*blushes* That... might have sounded a bit odd, my lady. I was merely asking whether you want some help with... common necessities, like preparing a resting place. I also did that for my mentor, as I already pointed out... I mean I helped him a lot, too. *ahem* Maybe it's not the best of ideas, my lady, but if you need any help feel free to seek my assistance.~
@27   = ~Look, my lady, how the setting sun bathes the scenery in its warm light...~
@28   = ~It's beautiful, isn't it?~
@29   = ~You are right. The sun is going down. We should start searching for a place to settle down for the night.~
@30   = ~My lady, this sight... sends shivers of awe down my spine and fills my heart with yearning...~
@31   = ~Ajantis, you are talking about the landscape but your eyes are focused... on me...~
@32   = ~How your choice of words has changed recently. It was only a little while ago that you said that such a sight inspired strength in you for your fight against evil...~
@33   = ~When you say "yearning," why is it that you stare at me so intensely, Ajantis?~
@34   = ~Well... I... I was talking about the wonderful vision I enjoy, my lady - every day that I travel with you. *clears his throat* Let us look for a resting place, before it gets too dark.~
@35   = ~That is still the case... and it inspires me even more, now... ~
@36   = ~Let us look for a resting place before it gets too dark.~
@37   = ~Please excuse me, my lady, if you got that impression. I would not even dream of bothering you. Let us look for a resting place before it gets too dark.~
@38   = ~My love, this request may not seem appropriate considering the dangers we could face at any moment. If I assured you that my vigilance is unbroken... would... would you think it too bold if I kissed you?~
@39   = ~*smiles* Don't talk, just do it, Ajantis.~
@40   = ~You are right about the dangers, you know. Let's save it for a better moment.~
@41   = ~What a great joy. I thank you, my love. Let me hold you close for this precious moment...~
@42   = ~I guess you are right. *sighs under his breath*~
@43   = ~My love, having you by my side gives me strength in every moment we are on the road. May I ask for a sign of your favour, beautiful lady? A lock of your hair, so I can carry it with me in the days that are to come?~
@44   = ~Oh, that's lovely. Of course, Ajantis. *You cut a lock of your hair and give it to him.*~
@45   = ~You would like a lock of my hair? Hmm, all right, if you think so... *You cut a lock of your hair and give it to him.*~
@46   = ~No, I don't like this idea, Ajantis.~
@47   = ~I hold a lock of your hair, and I delight in it. Your hair is as soft as silk, my love. I shall carry your favour within my helmet, and it will lead me through the darkest of times. I thank you, my love!~
@48   = ~Then please forgive me if I have bothered you with this, my love.~
