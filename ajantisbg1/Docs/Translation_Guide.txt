Translation guide for the romance part of the Ajantis Expansion Mod (AEM): Differences to the BG1NPC Project tra-lines. Why double the work?

In this document it is specified which textlines were directly taken out of the BG1NPC Project Ajantis romance. The BG1 romance had to be altered a bit due to the restrictions of the BG1 engine, so there are new lines, but a lot of them are the same as in the BG1NPC Project.

Note: Some textlines are combined with sound references. For BG1, the soundfiles are called [AJANTXX], "XX" being a number. In the BG1NPC Project, the soundfiles are given in the form [%tutu_var%AJANTXX]. This should be adjusted accordingly, if translations are taken from one mod for the other. Apart from that, the wording is the same if specified below.


File "Ajantis_Messenger.tra" from AEM is equivalent to "x#ajroadd_pr.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.

All lines in file "Ajantis_RepReactions.tra" from AEM are equivalent to the lines with the same number in "x#ajint.tra" from BG1NPC Project.

File "ajantisbhaallts.tra" from AEM is equivalent to "x#ajantisbhaallts.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.

File "ajantisbhaallts_RA1.tra" from AEM is equivalent to lines @132 to @201 in "x#ajint.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.

File "ajantisdreamlts.tra" from AEM is equivalent to "x#ajantisdreamlts.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.

File "Ajantisiniflirts_d.tra" from AEM is equivalent to "x#ajantisiniflirts_pr.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.

File "AjantisLTs.tra" from AEM, @0 to line @1262: equivalent to the lines with the same number in "x#ajantislts_pr.tra" from BG1NPC Project. 
Note: In "AjantisLTs.tra" (from AEM), there are not used lines in between that were taken out for the English version. They don't have to be taken out, though, so the translations of lines @0 to @1262 could be copied&pasted directly from the BG1NPC Project, if available. If the translation from AEM should be used for BG1NPC Project, make sure you add the missing lines (there are several).

All lines in file "AjantisLTs_Add.tra" from AEM are equivalent to the lines with the same number in "x#ajantisaddlts_pr.tra" from BG1NPC Project.

All lines in file "AjantisPC_PID.tra" from AEM are equivalent to the lines with the same number in "x#pcinit_tmp.tra" from BG1NPC Project.

File "AjantisPCiniflirts.tra" from AEM, @0 to line @339: equivalent to the lines with the same number in "x#ajpcfl_tmp.tra" from BG1NPC Project. 

File "AjantisRomnpc_talks.tra" from AEM is equivalent to "x#ajantisnpc_talks_pr.tra" from BG1NPC Project: Fully equivalent, including the numbering.
