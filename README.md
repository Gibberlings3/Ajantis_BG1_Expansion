# Ajantis BG1 Expansion Modification
by jastey                                
More content (dialogues, banters) for Ajantis in BG1!
A Mod for BG1(TotSC), Baldur's Gate Trilogy, Tutu, BG:EE, and EET.

For original BG1 (with or without TotSC), the mod adds a friendship track and the [BG1NPC project](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/bg1npc/) romance for Ajantis. The original BG1NPC project romance was slightly altered to adjust to the restrictions of the BG1 engine, although overall the content stayed the same.

For Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET, the mod adds a friendship track and more romance content for the BG1NPC Project romance for Ajantis. Content-wise, the mod is meant as an addition to the BG1NPC project, but technically it can be installed and played without the BG1NPC project.

For EE, the mod also adds several banters with Rassad and one with Baeloth, as well as a Rasaad-Ajantis romance conflict.

For SoD, the mod adds farewell dialogues before Ajantis leaves. In romance case the PC will get three letters from Ajantis along the SoD campaign.

The [BG1NPC project](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/bg1npc/) can be found at the Gibberlings Three site.

For BG:EE and EET there will be a second install option to use the existent BAM for Ajantis' shield (green dragon on golden back), if BG1NPC is installed.
